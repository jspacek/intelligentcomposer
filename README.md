The intelligent machine is self-generating based on parameters sent from Max MSP. It responds to literal variables encoded in the OSC messages.

There are three main functions that the intelligent machine and patch implement; 1) read, 2) compose, and 3) rate. The read functionality accepts parameters for motive retrieval that is initiated by random selection. The compose functionality sends a request to the intelligent machine which triggers it to respond with a new variation of a melody based on length. The rating functionality allows the supervisor to rate the last composed motive that the intelligent composer generated.
